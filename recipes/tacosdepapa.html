    <h2>Tacos de Papa.</h2>
    <p>Tacos never dissapoint. This recepie was a favorite on weekend dinners at home. We would prep the potatoe dough days before. It was easy to cook midweek, delicious and always tastes good.</p>

    <p>You can embelish at the end with sour cream, lettuce and tomatoe. Just don't forget the salsa. It can make all the difference.</p>
 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup of Shredded Cheese</li>
        <li>About 20 Tortillas</li>
        <li>Oil (Based on the size of skillet. Use best judgement.)</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp of Pepper</li>
        <li>Shredded Lettuce</li>
        <li>Sliced Tomatoe</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>
        <li>Salsa</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a pot of water and add the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Once the potatoes are soft enough to easily be punctured by a knife, drain the pot.</li>
        <li>Let the potatoes cool down till they are warm. Do not let them get cold.</li>
        <li>While the potatoes are still warm. Add the shredded cheese to the bowl along with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Smash all the ingredients till they are of the consistency similar to dough.</li>
        <li>Heat a comal.</li>
        <li>Once the comal is hot, warm up tortillas. The tortillas should not be fully cooked. They should be cooked enough that they can be easily folded, but are not hard.</li>
        <li>Add a ball of potatoe dough to the tortilla and fold. Do not over stuff since this will cause the dough to melt and spill into the skillet when its cooking.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet and oil. Once the oil is hot begin to fry the tacos in batches of 3 or 4. They are finished when they look golden all over.</li>
        <li>Garnish the tacos by opening up the taco and adding sliced tomatoes, lettuce and salsa. </li>

    </ol>
